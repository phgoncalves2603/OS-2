## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Basic Test (3 Processes)
| Process | Burst Time | Priority |
|:-------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| P1      | 4          | 1        |
| P2      | 8          | 2        |
| P3      | 2          | 3        |

**Description:**  
- Small test case to verify basic functionality.
- Mix of burst times to test short and long processes.
- Sequential priorities (1, 2, 3).

---

### Test Case 2: Medium Load (5 Processes)
| Process | Burst Time | Priority |
|:-------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| P1      | 6          | 3        |
| P2      | 4          | 1        |
| P3      | 8          | 4        |
| P4      | 2          | 2        |
| P5      | 5          | 5        |

**Description:**  
- Medium-sized test with more varied workloads.
- Mix of short and long processes.
- Non-sequential priorities (tests priority handling).

---

### Test Case 3: Edge Case (4 Processes)
| Process | Burst Time | Priority |
|:-------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| P1      | 4          | 1        |
| P2      | 4          | 2        |
| P3      | 4          | 3        |
| P4      | 4          | 4        |

**Description:**  
- Edge case test with identical burst times.
- Sequential priorities.
- Good for testing fairness in scheduling.


## Algorithm Implementations

1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**
   - Non-preemptive
   - Processes are executed in arrival order
   - Simple and fair for equal burst times
   - May lead to convoy effect with varying burst times

2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
   - Non-preemptive
   - Selects process with shortest burst time
   - Optimal for average waiting time
   - May lead to starvation of longer processes

3. **Priority Scheduling**
   - Processes are executed based on priority
   - Lower number indicates higher priority
   - Supports dynamic priority changes
   - May lead to priority inversion

4. **Round Robin**
   - Time quantum based scheduling
   - Default quantum = 2 time units
   - Fair distribution of CPU time
   - Good for time-sharing systems

5. **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**
   - Preemptive version of SJF
   - Switches to shorter processes when they arrive
   - Optimal for average waiting time
   - Higher overhead due to frequent context switches

6. **MLFQ (Multi-Level Feedback Queue)**
   - Multiple priority queues
   - Dynamic priority adjustment
   - Time quantum varies by queue level
   - Balances throughput and response time

## Performance Metrics

The simulator calculates and displays the following metrics:

1. **Average Waiting Time (AWT)**
   - Time processes spend waiting in ready queue
   - Lower is better
   - Formula: (Total Waiting Time) / (Number of Processes)

2. **Average Turnaround Time (ATT)**
   - Total time from submission to completion
   - Includes waiting time and execution time
   - Formula: (Total Turnaround Time) / (Number of Processes)

3. **CPU Utilization**
   - Percentage of time CPU is busy
   - Higher is better
   - Formula: (Total Burst Time) / (Total Time) × 100

The issue is that we need to modify the RunAlgorithm method in the SchedulingTester class to actually capture the returned average waiting time. Here's the corrected SchedulingTester.cs:
Apply to readme.md
The main changes are:
Removed the RunAlgorithm helper method and directly calling the algorithm methods
Storing the actual returned values from the algorithms
Calculating turnaround time as waiting time + average burst time
Improved the formatting of the results table
Also, make sure your TestData.cs file is correct:
Apply to readme.md
This should now show the actual calculated average waiting times and turnaround times for each algorithm. Would you like me to explain any part of these changes?
can you give a sumarry about the tests? like how many processors for each test and burs

Here's a summary of the test cases:
Apply to readme.md
Let me explain each test case:
Test Case 1 (3 Processes)
Small test case to verify basic functionality
Mix of burst times (2, 4, 8) to test different process lengths
Sequential priorities (1, 2, 3)
Good for testing basic scheduling behavior
Test Case 2 (5 Processes)
Medium-sized test with more varied workload
Burst times: 6, 4, 8, 2, 5 (mix of short and long processes)
Priorities: 3, 1, 4, 2, 5 (non-sequential to test priority handling)
Good for testing how algorithms handle more complex scenarios
Test Case 3 (4 Processes)
Edge case test with identical burst times (all 4)
Sequential priorities (1, 2, 3, 4)
Tests how algorithms handle equal burst times
Particularly useful for testing fairness in scheduling
These test cases help evaluate:
How algorithms handle different process lengths
Priority management
Fairness in scheduling
Performance with different workload sizes
Edge cases like identical burst times
Would you like me to add this summary to the test output, or would you like more details about any specific test case?
